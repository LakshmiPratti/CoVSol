# Predicting the aqueous solubility directly from molecular structure
Markup : * Solubility is one of the important parameters to achieve desired concentration of drug in systemic circulation for achieving required pharmacological response.
         * Poorly water soluble drugs often require high doses in order to reach therapeutic plasma concentrations after oral administration.
         * Low aqueous solubility is the major problem encountered with formulation development of new chemical entities as well as generic development. Any drug to be absorbed must be present in the form of an aqueous solution at the site of absorption. Water is the solvent of choice for liquid pharmaceutical formulations.
         * Ideally, a “well-balanced” drug molecule must be sufficiently hydrophilic to be soluble in aqueous biological liquids and buffer solutions but also sufficiently lipophilic to penetrate through biological membranes.

## Objective
Markup : * To predict the solubility of the compounds directly from their structure.
         * To serve as a virtual screening of drugs with high solubility.
## Dataset
Markup : * A total of 3048 compounds collected from DockCoV2 database after filtering out redundant compounds and those which doesn't have information about solubilty values and logP values.

## Model
Markup : * Different machine learning methods and neural network models will be implemented and their performance in predicting the aqueous solubility will be compared
