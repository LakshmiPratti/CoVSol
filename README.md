# Predicting the aqueous solubility directly from molecular structure

* Solubility is one of the important parameters to achieve desired concentration of drug in systemic circulation for achieving required pharmacological response.
* Poorly water soluble drugs often require high doses in order to reach therapeutic plasma concentrations after oral administration.
* Low aqueous solubility is the major problem encountered with formulation development of new chemical entities as well as generic development.
* Ideally, a “well-balanced” drug molecule must be sufficiently hydrophilic to be soluble in aqueous biological liquids and buffer solutions but also sufficiently lipophilic to penetrate through biological membranes.

## Objective
* To predict the solubility of the compounds directly from their structure.
* To serve as a virtual screening of drugs with high solubility.

## Dataset
* A total of 3048 compounds collected from DockCoV2 database after filtering out compounds which doesn't have information about solubility values and logP values.

## Model
* Different machine learning methods and neural network models will be implemented and their performance in predicting the aqueous solubility will be compared.

## Requirements
* Python 3.6 and above
* Installing DeepChem
* Installing rdkit
